## Text-based blackjack game that I developed at the end of my junior year, while taking AP Computer Science A. Uses most basic principles of Java: arrays, variables, methods, etc. Learned a lot from this, like how important it is to create a plan before I jump right in to coding, since I had to completely restart once on this project. Could definitely optimize this if I revisited it.
